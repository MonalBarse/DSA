/*
    Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N.
    Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
    You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available
    and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

    Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under
    the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.

    NOTE:
        1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be
            painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
        2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where
            painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

/*
 * The Celebrity Problem
 * There is a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n-1). A party is
 * considered to be a celebrity if there is a person (let's call them the
 * celebrity) such that:
 * - The celebrity knows no one at the party.
 * - Everyone at the party knows the celebrity.
 *
 * You are given a n x n binary matrix, also the number of people is n.
 * The matrix is defined as follows:
 * - matrix[i][j] = 1 if person i knows person j, and
 * - matrix[i][j] = 0 if person i does not know person j.
 *
 * You need to find the celebrity at the party, if there is one.
 * If there is no celebrity, return -1.

# DSA (JAVA)

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the Java source files.
- `bin/`: Contains the compiled Java class files.

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/MonalBarse/DSA
```

## Bash Scripts

- `automation.sh`: A bash script to automate many things:
  - Create a new Topic folder
  - Add a subtopic to existing Topic
  - Compile a Java file
  - Run a compiled class
  - Quick compile and run
  - List all Topics and it's subtopics
  - Basic Git Operations - Push to your remote repository

Make sure you find the `automation.sh` file here - [./automation.sh](./automation.sh) and Change the variable for creating topics
it is currently src/com/monal, edit it to add yours.

```bash
    chmod +x automation.sh
    ./automation.sh
```
